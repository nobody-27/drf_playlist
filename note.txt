In Django REST Framework, serializers are responsible for converting 
complex data such as querysets and model instances to native Python datatypes 
(called serialization) that can then be easily rendered into JSON, XML or other content
 types which is understandable by Front End.


Serializers are also responsible for deserialization which means it allows parsed data 
to be converted back into complex types, after first validating the incoming data.
